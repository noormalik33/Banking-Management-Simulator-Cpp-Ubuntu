Banking Transaction Processing System Simulation 🏦💸
Overview 🌟
This project is a C++-based simulation of a modern banking transaction processing system, designed to demonstrate key operating system concepts such as process management, synchronization, memory management, and priority scheduling. The system simulates a multi-branch banking environment where customers perform concurrent financial transactions (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, transfers) via ATMs, teller windows, and online services. It manages limited resources like funds, processing capacity, and security tokens, ensuring efficient coordination, transaction integrity, and robust error handling. 🚀
Project Description 📖✨
Purpose 🎯
The Banking Transaction Processing System simulates a real-world banking environment, emphasizing operating system principles in a financial context. It models concurrent transaction processing across multiple branches and service channels, handling resource constraints, synchronization, and dynamic priority scheduling. The system ensures secure and efficient transaction execution while adapting to real-time conditions such as system load, security incidents, and maintenance periods. This project serves as both an educational tool and a showcase of system programming skills. 📚💻
Key Features 🌟

Resource Management 🏧: Simulates availability of funds, ATMs, teller windows, and security tokens, with dynamic allocation and replenishment based on daily cycles or fund transfers.
Concurrent Processing 🔄: Uses POSIX threads to handle multiple transactions simultaneously, with synchronization via mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables to prevent race conditions.
Priority Scheduling ⏰: Implements a priority-based scheduling algorithm to prioritize critical transactions (e.g., security alerts, VIP transfers) using separate queues for critical, high, medium, and low-priority transactions.
Memory Management 💾: Manages account data, transaction logs, and security records using shared memory for inter-component communication and optimized data retrieval.
I/O Simulation 🌐: Models external factors like network issues, maintenance windows, and security checks, introducing realistic delays and constraints.
Error Handling 🛡️: Handles scenarios like insufficient funds, network failures, and system overloads with graceful recovery mechanisms.
Dynamic Resource Allocation 📈: Adjusts processing capacity and transaction limits based on demand, using LRU techniques for resource management.
Realistic Behavior 🕒: Simulates business hours, peak transaction times, and maintenance periods for authentic banking system dynamics.

Technical Implementation 🛠️

Language: C++ (Standard C++11 or later) 🖌️
Libraries: POSIX threads (pthread), Standard C++ Library, POSIX shared memory (shm_open, mmap) 📚
System Calls: fork(), shm_open(), mmap(), sem_init(), pthread_mutex, pthread_cond 🔧
Synchronization: Uses mutexes for account access, semaphores for resource limits, and condition variables for transaction queue coordination. 🔒
Priority Queues: Maintains separate queues for critical, high, medium, and low-priority transactions, processed in order of importance with tiebreakers based on submission time or customer status. 📋
Memory: Shared memory for account balances and transaction logs, optimized for fast access and updates. 💾
I/O: Simulates delays for network issues or security checks, with dynamic priority adjustments for incidents like fraud detection. 🌐
Resource Management: Implements LRU for resource replacement and dynamic allocation based on system load. 🔄

Architecture 🏗️
The system comprises:

Central Coordinator 📡: Manages transaction queues, resource allocation, and system-wide synchronization.
Transaction Processor 💸: Executes transactions (e.g., deposits, transfers) in separate threads, ensuring isolation and integrity.
Account Manager 📊: Maintains account balances and transaction histories in shared memory.
Security Validator 🔐: Enforces security protocols, escalating priorities for fraud alerts or regulatory compliance.
Audit System 📝: Logs transactions and system events for traceability.
I/O Simulator 🌍: Introduces realistic delays and constraints (e.g., network failures, maintenance).

Priority Scheduling Logic ⏳
Priority Levels:

Critical: Security alerts, fraud detection, system maintenance, regulatory tasks. 🚨
High: VIP transactions, large transfers, time-sensitive payments. 💰
Medium: Regular transactions, standard transfers, inquiries. 📄
Low: Balance checks, history requests, non-urgent updates. 📋

Scheduling Details:

Queues: Separate queues for each priority level, processed sequentially from critical to low. 📑
Dynamic Adjustments: Priorities escalate for security incidents or unusual patterns, with real-time monitoring. 🔍
Tiebreakers: Uses submission time or customer status for same-priority transactions. ⏱️
Resource Allocation: Directs high-priority transactions to available resources, optimizing system capacity. ⚙️

Limitations ⚠️

Limited to a fixed number of concurrent transactions based on simulated resource constraints.
Simplified security model; does not implement cryptographic protocols.
No persistent storage; data is in-memory and reset on program termination.
Does not support complex transaction types like loans or investments.

Future Enhancements 🚀

Add persistent storage for account data and transaction logs. 💾
Implement cryptographic security for transactions. 🔐
Support advanced transaction types and batch processing. 📈
Introduce a graphical interface for monitoring system status. 📊

Requirements 📋

Operating System: Unix-like (Linux, macOS, etc.) 🐧
Compiler: g++ (C++11 or later) 🖌️
Dependencies: POSIX threads, Standard C++ Library, POSIX shared memory 📚

Installation 📦

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/noormalik33/Banking-Management-Simulator-Cpp-Ubuntu.git
cd Banking-Management-Simulator-Cpp-Ubuntu


Compile the source code:g++ -o banksim main.cpp -pthread


Run the simulation:./banksim



Usage 🎮

Launch the simulation with ./banksim. 🖥️
The system simulates a banking environment with predefined accounts and resources. 🏦
Transactions are generated automatically or can be input manually (depending on implementation):
Example: deposit 1001 500 (deposit $500 to account 1001)
Example: transfer 1001 1002 1000 (transfer $1000 from account 1001 to 1002)


View transaction logs and system status in the console output. 📜
Exit with Ctrl+C or a predefined termination command. 🛑

Example Output
[INFO] System initialized: 5 ATMs, 10 tellers, $100000 funds available
[CRITICAL] Security alert: Account 1001 flagged for review
[HIGH] Processing transfer: $5000 from 1002 to 1003
 MEDIUM] Deposit: $200 to account 1004
[LOW] Balance check: Account 1005 = $1500
